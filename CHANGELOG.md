# Changelog

## 1.0.0

### Added

- Panedesk and pdesk launchers with slim-by-default profiles, optional full compositions and interactive provider setup.
- Session ledgers, subagent monitoring, statistics, node administration and opt-in seat orchestration in the Web composition.
- Authenticated owner approval, protected credential storage and Linux connection-source admission.

### Changed

- Disabled telemetry and product analytics by default and separated Panedesk branding from upstream DeepSeek Harness.
- Anchored Linux file operations to directory descriptors and enabled the Windows experimental handle backend by default.
- Reduced repeated protected-root scans during startup and preserved approved input state across restarts.

### Known limitations

- Windows console sharing and incomplete network isolation require separate OS accounts for untrusted tasks and Web-based owner approval.
- macOS path-based writes and unverified native platform enforcement remain restricted; see [platform behavior](README.md#platform-behavior).
- Windows extraction paths, file replacement permissions and first-start preparation need care; use a short path and follow [known limitations](README.md#known-limitations).
- Windows native builds are not byte-for-byte reproducible; use distributed artifacts with their supplied checksums.
